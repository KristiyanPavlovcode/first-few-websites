# first-few-websites
First projects ever. They are written in Bulgarian, so there is no translation for the non-Bulgarian speakers right now.

The websites are about:
  1. Brief biography of Jennifer Aniston and Nina Dobrev.
  2. Content page of a book about Computer viruses.
  3. Showcase of several laptops and tablets.
    (Pictures included in all of them).
   
      Hope you like it.
